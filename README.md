## News Buddy â€“ India (AI Pit Crew)

Trusted personal news companion for India with an AI pit crew: fact-check, translate, summarize, personalize. Four modes: Read, Listen, Watch, Multilingual.

### Architecture
- FastAPI backend (`backend/app`) with modular services:
  - Fact-check (web meta-search), Bias inference (heuristic map), Summarize (frequency-based), Translate (GoogleTranslator), TTS (gTTS), Slides (Pillow)
- Static frontend (`frontend`) mounted by backend with clean, approachable UI
- Static assets served under `/static`

### Run locally
1) Ensure Python 3.10+ is available. If `apt` is restricted, use system Python.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open the UI at `http://localhost:8000` and the API at `http://localhost:8000/api/news`.

### API
- `GET /api/news?mode=read|listen|watch|multilingual&language=en|hi|...&topics=cricket,tech`
- `POST /api/tts` `{ text, language }` -> MP3 URL
- `POST /api/slides` `{ text, language }` -> slide image URLs

### Design principles
- Verified: show sources, fact-check confidence and links
- Bias-aware: display source bias label with rationale
- Transparent: explicit citations, clear indicators
- Personal: topics, language, and mode selection
- Buddy feel: friendly tone, low-friction UX, works with low bandwidth

### Notes
- Some services use public endpoints and may be limited in sandbox environments; graceful fallbacks included.
- RSS sources curated for Indian audience; extend in `services/ingest.py`.
